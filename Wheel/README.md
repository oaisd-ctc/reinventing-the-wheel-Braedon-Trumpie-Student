DESCRIPTION:
Our NuGet package will be utilized so that you ( the person reading this ) can use all sorts of functions.
( read the "what not to do" to find out what functions there are. )
We created this NuGet package to really understand what is going on behind the scenes. it is hard sometimes to 
understand what functions do what but actually going behind the scene and recreating functions is why we created
this NuGet package.

EXPLANATION:

MathUtils: recreating math functions. ( Ex: Power , SquareRoot , AbsoluteValue )
ArrayUtils: recreating array functions. ( Ex: Average , Max , Min )
StringUtils: recreating string functions. ( Ex: ToLower , Length , Reverse )

- - - - 

DETAILS:
You will create 3 static classes all encapsulated in 1 common namespace:
StringUtils
ArrayUtils
MathUtils
- - - -
 - > StringUtils

- what NOT to do:
ToUpper /
ToLower /
Length /
Reverse /
CountVowels /
CountConsonants /
HasLetter 

- What you SHOULD do:

> make these without using the command prompted by the computer.

- what NOT to do:
Average /
Max /
Min /
SortAscending /
SortDescending /
Sum /
Product 

- What you SHOULD do: 

> make these without using the command prompted by the computer.
>ArrayUtils - Each Array function should have at least 1 overload. For example, Average(int[]), and  Array(double[])

SquareRoot /
AbsoluteValue /
Min /
Max /
Add /
Subtract /
Divide /
Multiply 

- What you SHOULD do:

> make these without using the command prompted by the computer.
>MathUtils - Each Math function should have at least 2 overloads. For example, Power(int, int), Power(double, double) and Power(float, float)
